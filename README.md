This file contains some commands to use the ImageJ software in order to extract descriptive measures from a video file. The input file is a video in .lif format where you can see a lot of vesicles. You have to manually detect the vesicles by drawing circles around them. The setTool function mesure a lot of values like mean, min, max, median. The output file is a .csv file with all the vesicles in rows and all the measures in columns.
